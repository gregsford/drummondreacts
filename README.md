# drummondreacts
I created a website for my YouTube channel where I film myself reacting to songs for the first time.  

With the About and Blog pages, I made them so followers can get to know more about who I am and why music is important to me.

The Request page is where followers on the site can send in their requests for me as an alternative to leaving comments on YouTube.

The Videos section I completed, but I am hosting the site on Netlify and do not have the storage space available to upload videos that YouTube bans.
