                    <p class="about1">Music.  One of my biggest passions in life is music.  As far back as I can remember I was always a fan of music.  I remember being a young child and listening to Beach Boys while riding in my mothers car, listening to the Monkees while watching the tv show reruns on Nick-At-Nite, watching MTV and seeing music videos for Michael Jackson and Guns N Roses.  It was way back then that I knew that music was going to play a major role in my life.  At 8 years old I began taking drum lessons and eventually switched to guitar at age 10. I have been in many bands since I was in the 6th grade (I'm not currently in one now).  Although I'm not a musician by trade, I am one for the enjoyment of it.</p>

                    <p class="about2">It was back in 2018 that I had discovered reaction videos on YouTube. Being that one of the main reasons I went on YouTube was so I could discover new bands and artists to listen to that I normally would not have known about.  Examples of them include artists like Animals As Leaders, Biffy Clyro, Chris Stapleton, Damien Rice, Gojira, Rebel Son just to name a very few.  But I also enjoyed the idea of documenting the reaction to hearing a new band for the first time.  Believe me if a camera had been recording when I first heard 'Teething' by the Deftones or 'Future Breed Machine' by Meshuggah in the mid-90's, those videos would have several views on them by now. Maybe even reaching the hundreds!!</p>

                    <p class="about3">Ever since I have started this channel, many people have turned me on to so many new artists that I would have never known about otherwise. I look forward to discovering more songs through your suggestions.  And from time to time, I hope that I might be able to help others discover new music either from passing through my videos or sharing some bands that I think a lot of people are unaware of.  Growing up in New York City, there was always a plethora of underground music venues and scenes that never made any mainstream success, but still made amazing music that should be shared with others.</p>
