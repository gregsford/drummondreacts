                <h2>2022. April. 17</h2>
                <p>Well, shit. If I had known that I was going to be away this long, I would've said what my old man said to me; "I'll be back. Going to the store for beers and smokes".  Today I spent a good portion of time developing the website. Hopefully it should be completed soon and launched for everyone to enjoy... or not. As far as making videos go, I plan to get back into recording soon.  I have a big backlog of songs to check out and then tons of editing once everything is recorded. Reaching for a summer goal to get that back up again.</p>
